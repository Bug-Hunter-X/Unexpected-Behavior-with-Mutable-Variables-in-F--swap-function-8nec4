This example demonstrates a common pitfall in F#: the unexpected behavior of mutable variables when passed to functions.  In the provided `swap` function, the intent is to swap the values of `x` and `y`. However, because mutable variables are passed by reference, the function modifies the original variables directly, producing an output different from the programmer's intention.  The solution demonstrates how to avoid this problem by returning a tuple containing the swapped values.
